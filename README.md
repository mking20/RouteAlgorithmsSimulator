# RouteAlgorithmsSimulator
This project is the Final project for Algorithms Design from the ICE major at CETYS Universidad. Our project consists in a graphic interface that allows you to select how you would like a path finding problem to be solved.
  - In the given space, you select how big you want the space to be that the object is going to travel.
  - Obstacles are going to be set along that space.
  - Then, you will be able to select 1 of three ways to find a way towards the exit: 
    - Bellman-Ford
    - A*
    - Concurrent Dijkstra
  - The object will start to find its way through as soon as you select the algorithm, the passed spaces will be colored differently.

### Support

Route Algorithms Simulator used the following modules to work correctly:


 - [PyQT] - Helps with the graphics in a user-friendly way
  
 - [heapq]
 

 - [Numpy]: We used this library because it adds support for large multi-dimension arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
