# RouteAlgorithmsSimulator
This project is the Final project for Algorithms Design from the ICE major at CETYS Universidad. Our project consists in a graphic interface that allows you to select how you would like a path finding problem to be solved.
  - In the given space, you select how big you want the space to be that the object is going to travel.
  - Obstacles are going to be set along that space.
  - Then, you will be able to select 1 of three ways to find a way towards the exit: 
    - Bellman-Ford
    - A*
    - Concurrent Dijkstra
  - The object will start to find its way through as soon as you select the algorithm, the passed spaces will be colored differently.
